raspberry pi 3 has two UART (ttyama0) its for bluetooth
and mini UART(ttysys0) is for communication
but we can disble the bluetooth and ttyama0 can be used for communication with other microcontroller.

two types of pin out on pi
board pin- physical pin number
bcm pin - gpio number (see the pin diagram)



this image will automatically connect to wifi
ssid = sanket
pass = 1234567890

ssid = DIGISOL
pass = navjivan
